• Designed and developed an Android mobile app using Kotlin to display real-time weather information, integrating APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for current conditions, forecasts, and location-based data.

• Implemented key features including current local weather with max/min temperatures, wind and humidity display with icons, 5-day weather forecasts, and a search function to query weather for other locations (e.g., switching to Tokyo's weather).

• Added dynamic UI elements such as weather-dependent background changes (e.g., sunny, snowy, rainy, cloudy, foggy) and time-based adjustments (e.g., night mode before 6 AM and after 6 PM).
